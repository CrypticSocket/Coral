                    <p class="genText">Like corals maintain restoration and balance in the oceans, similarly, our device has been called Coral as it exists in water bodies, without disturbing it’s surrounding environment and protects the lake from being polluted or contaminated. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Coral uses existing technologies such as IoT and a mesh network to collect data using sensors dispersed all across the lake, to trigger a response depending on the contamination levels of the lake. All the devices work with a hive mind, which means that the main data collection unit is a mother-bot which houses an IoT module to send the collected data onto a private server. -->

                <h2 class="secHeading">What created Coral?</h2>
                <div class="linear">
                    <p class="genText">
                    Fresh water bodies which could help solve the issue of water scarcity are polluted. Bangalore was once home to over 280 clean lakes, sadly, now only 183 lakes remain most of which are very polluted.
                    <br><br>
                    Coral was born out of the idea that the society needed to be aware about the water bodies around them. It's the role of each one of us to take care of it.
                    <!-- The maintenance of the existing lakes and water bodies are managed extremely poorly, most of the industrial waste and human waste is let into these water bodies without any treatment, this results in the contamination of lakes which then become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other bacteria which can be extremely dangerous for the people who live in close proximity of these water bodies.<br><br> -->
                    <!-- Our devices will force the governing bodies to take action on the contaminations as it collects data regarding pollution levels in the lake beds and if the lake is unhealthy, the data is directly posted on social media which immediately forces the action to be taken and keeps the authorities accountable for their negligence, the data is monitored and studied in a way that allows for everyone to be a part of the process and initialize or raise awareness to this relevant issue and more importantly, acts on it.   As a society, as much as it is our responsibility to bring awareness to a particular issue, it is equally important for us to initiate working on those issues rather than put the blame on authorities. This is us trying to break that chain. -->

                        Coral uses existing technologies such as IoT and a Mesh Network to collect data using sensors in <em>Scouts</em> dispersed all across the water body.
                        These scouts have cost effective sensors installed which is displayed live here.
