                <div class="linear">
                    <p class="genText">Corals are exoskeletons of marine invertebrates that exist in the ocean bed and protect the ocean in multiple ways, be it provide shelter for many marine organisms or be a solid barricade for higher tides. Corals maintain restoration and balance in the oceans, similarly, our device has been called coral as it exists in a lake, without disturbing it’s surrounding environment and protects the lake from being polluted or contaminated. <br><br>
                    Our device serves as a noble attempt to restore our lakebed conditions that have been exploited and polluted with industrial waste or inadequate maintenance. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Coral uses existing technologies such as IoT and a mesh network to collect data using sensors dispersed all across the lake, to trigger a response depending on the contamination levels of the lake. All the devices work with a hive mind, which means that the main data collection unit is a mother-bot which houses an IoT module to send the collected data onto a private server.</p>

                <h2 class="secHeading">Why?</h2>
                <div class="linear">
                    <p class="genText">Although industrialization has gotten has resulted in rapid evolution for us as a species, it has done as much damage to nature without a doubt. Humans have been gifted with resources, but it has made us exploit and abuse those resources with little to no regulation, it is much later we realize how detrimental it is for our planet.<br> <br>
                    Bangalore was once home to over 280 lakes, rapid urbanization has now brought that number down to 183, for a city once known to be for its water bodies, it is shameful.<br><br>
                    The maintenance of the existing lakes and water bodies are managed extremely poorly, most of the industrial waste and human waste is let into these water bodies without any treatment, this results in the contamination of lakes which then become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other bacteria which can be extremely dangerous for the people who live in close proximity of these water bodies.<br><br>
                    Our devices will force the governing bodies to take action on the contaminations as it collects data regarding pollution levels in the lake beds and if the lake is unhealthy, the data is directly posted on social media which immediately forces the action to be taken and keeps the authorities accountable for their negligence, the data is monitored and studied in a way that allows for everyone to be a part of the process and initialize or raise awareness to this relevant issue and more importantly, acts on it.   As a society, as much as it is our responsibility to bring awareness to a particular issue, it is equally important for us to initiate working on those issues rather than put the blame on authorities. This is us trying to break that chain.</p>
